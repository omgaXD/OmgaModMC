Following the old bizzare tradition of Terraria of naming mods by own nicknames, this mod heavily relies on multiple dependencies, technically making it a small modpack.
# Technical info: 
This modpack is based on Create and TConstruct mechanics, but main content comes from the core mod. KubeJS is used to tie everything together.
# Content:
- A long progression chain of metals, starting with iron, ending with ibraium.
- Each metal in chain has unique traits and craft, also bringing a related item with special capabilities.
- Most of Create and TConstruct recipes are unchanged.
- Alchemy - a simple system of mixing dyes with certain "catalysts" that turn them into useful minerals, making practically anything mineable underground renewable.
- New funny food - Shroom that can be turned into pear which can be turned into another fruit, each having special capabilities - what else does a tech modpack need?
- Enchantment book crafts - even these can be automated at later points of the game! Why? We'll figure out later!
# Current progress:
I'm working on code and making sprites, while my classmate friends sometimes help me with latter.
# Why does this blend of all the different stuff even exist?:
The answer is shrimple: during online classes, we played with my friends a lot and we came up with weirdest ideas, which I decided to move into a mod. When I learned about KubeJS, I instantly changed my mind - I should make a modpack instead! I love modding and coding in general - this was an opportunity not to miss.
# How do I know if I want to play it?:
It was intentionally made for me and the bois, however, anybody who searches for lightweight modpack that doesn't affect much of Create and TConstruct but heavily rely on them - might actually like this one!
