This repository, its contents and releases are all under the "License license license" license.
Below are listed all the components of "Omgapack" modpack and license requirements along them.

General:
1. If any situation is not stated in this file, just ask. My discord is omga#6964. When you reach out to me, please ask right away - I'm not a huge fan of responding to "hello".

Code:
1. You're allowed to use code snippets like classes, functions, methods or their part for purposes of learning and creating your own mod/modpack. You don't have to leave any credit for using any code, however leaving a comment in copied code is always appreciated.
2. Please avoid strict copying of any modpack-specific JS scripts (this rule only excludes KubeJS scripts dedicated to crafting and similar)
3. Avoid using more than 4 Java classes of this code.
If you break any of those 3 rules, I will have the right to ask you to get rid of any violations before you release next version of your mod/modpack.

Sprites:
1. You're not allowed to use any .png files of this repository unless I allow you directly in discord. This includes slightly modified/recolored/adjusted textures.
If you break this rule, I will have the right to ask you to remove or replace the violating texture until you release next version of your mod/modpack. In case the violation is heavy (more than 2 textures copied), I'll reach out to curseforge to complain about copyright and theft and etc..

JSON files:
1. You have no restrictions in terms of usage of JSON files provided by this repository.
